# RAiD API

The [Data LifeCycle Framework](www.dlc.edu.au) (DLC) has been initiated by five primary organisations; [Australian Access Federation](https://aaf.edu.au/) (AAF), [Australiaâ€™s Academic and Research Network](https://www.aarnet.edu.au/) (AARNet), [Australian National Data Service](http://www.ands.org.au/) (ANDS), [National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources](https://nectar.org.au/) (NeCTAR) and [Research Data Services](http://www.rds.edu.au/) (RDS).

The DLCF is a nationwide effort to connect research resources and activities such that researchers can make the best use of existing national, state-based, local, and commercial eResearch tools. It aims to provide a simple path to reliable provenance, more effective collaboration across organisations and assist researchers to position themselves to address the growing potential of increasingly open data.

The DLCF will connect critical elements and points in time of the data journey from grant approval through to project finalisation, results publication and archiving. It will leverage existing eResearch investment to provide a flexible and dynamic national framework supporting research.

The Resource and Activity Persistent identifier (RAiD) is the first of the enabling technologies required for the DLCF. The RAiD API is a '**proof of concept**' [Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) implementation designed to be hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) that will help create and manage RAiDs.

## Serverless Components
AWS serverless applications are able to conform to a [multi-tier architecture]( https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/AWS_Serverless_Multi-Tier_Architectures.pdf), consisting of three defined tiers:
* Data - Store all research activity information and generated JWT tokens for research organisations and providers in AWS DynamoDB (NOSQL). AFF authenticated users JWT tokens are not stored as they are provided by RAPID AAF.
* Logic - RESTful api call are mapped to end points mapped in Amazon API Gateway. API Gateway processes HTTP requests by using micro-services (AWS Lambda using Python runtime) behind a custom security policy (JWT token validation). HTTP status codes and responses are generated depending on the result of the AWS Lambda function.
* Presentation - Static assets (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc.) are stored in AWS S3 buckets with public HTTP GET access. AWS provides a HTTP endpoint for content hosting, but disallows server side generated content. This is overcome by storing authenticated sessions as cookies and producing dynamic content with RESTful calls to API Gateway.

## Getting Started
Development and deployment of the framework will require the following:
### Third-Party Integrations
Authentication validation and redirection is designed to be integrated with [Rapid AAF](https://rapid.aaf.edu.au/). The service will redirect to the static site via a RESTful *POST* call, providing a JWT token with AAF attributes.
Read the [Rapid AAF developer guide](https://rapid.aaf.edu.au/developers) and contact the [support desk](support@aaf.edu.au) for service registration. The application will need access to the following AAF attributes:
- mail
- auEduPersonSharedToken
- displayname
- o


### Prerequisites
* [Python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/):  AWS Lambda supported Python language runtime 2.7.
* [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) : Install and manage Python Modules
* [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/): Unified tool to manage your AWS services.
* [Boto3](https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) : Amazon Web Services SDK for Python. 

### Installing
```
# Install PIP
$ python get-pip.py

# Configure AWS CLI
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: <Access Key>
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: <Secret>
Default region name [None]: <Region>
Default output format [None]: ENTER

# Install Boto3
pip install boto3==1.4.4
```

### Environment & Secrets
Micro-services depend on environment variables to allow for an environment stage agnostic deployment model.

#### auth.py
- `JWT_AUDIENCE` Name of intended audience. Prevent valid tokens meant for other application to be used with this application.
- `JWT_ISSUER_3RD_PARTY` Name of 3rd party issuer of JWT provided token.
- `JWT_ISSUER_SELF` Name for self issued JWT provided token.
- `JWT_SECRET` Secret used for encryption/decryption of all JWT tokens.
- `SITE_URL` URL for all JWT authentication calls to be redirected to. This should be the URL endpoint of the static website.
- `SITE_DOMAIN` Shared domain of API Gateway and S3 static site. Setting and sharing authentication cookies requires a shared root domain. For example: The S3 site would be hosted on 'example.com' and API Gateway on 'api.example.com/v1/' with the shared domain as 'example.com'.

### Running locally
Install AWS Lambda functions module requirements using PIP.

```
# Install packages listed in requirements
$ pip install -r LambdaFunctions/requirements.txt
```

Run AWS Lambda handle locally using [Python Lambda Local](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-lambda-local/0.1.2) and a provided event json file.

```
# Install Python Lambda Local
$ pip install python-lambda-local==0.1.2

# Run Lambda handler with given event.json file
python-lambda-local -f lambda_handle -t 5 lambda_file.py event.json

```

## Deployment
### S3 Static site
Some *JavaScript* variables will need to be changed prior to being uploaded to match the application routing:
- StaticSite/js/global.js
```
# Replace wih the hosted API endpoint URL for all RESTful calls.

https://{API_URL_ENDPOINT}
```

- StaticSite/api/swagger.yaml
```
# Replace wih the hosted API endpoint URL
host: "https://{API_URL_ENDPOINT}"

# Replace with path of API version
basePath: "/{API_VERSION}"
```

- StaticSite/api/index.html
```
# Swagger API Sandbox file. The default is the *swagger.yaml* file.
url = "/api/swagger.yaml"
```

The structure of the '*StaticSite*' directory will match the public S3 bucket and website structure. Upload it to a publicly accessible bucket that is enabled as a static site.

```
# Upload all of static site content to the public S3 bucket
$ aws s3 cp /Local/Path s3://myPublicBucket/ --recursive
```

### AWS Lambda
Prepare Lambda files by creating [AWS Lambda Python Packages](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python-how-to-create-deployment-package.html) and uploading them to a private Amazon S3 Bucket. Create a Lambda function for 'jwt_validation_handler' and 'jwt_redirection_handler'.
```
# Copy Lambda functions to artifacts directory
$cp -R LambdaFunctions/. Artifacts/LambdaFunctions/

# Install packages listed in requirements to a directory for package deployment
$ pip install -r Artifacts/LambdaFunctions/requirements.txt -t Artifacts/LambdaFunctions/

# Create zip of function at root level and upload to private S3 bucket
$ zip -r Artifacts/LambdaFunctions/function.zip *
$ aws s3 cp Artifacts/LambdaFunctions/function.zip s3://myPrivateBucket//function.zip
```

### API Gateway
API Gateway paths are defined explicitly in the *YAML* files in SAM directory. *'SAM/RAiD-API-2.yaml'* represents a newer version with a custom authoriser for JWT tokens provided by AAF.
- SAM/RAiD-API.yaml and SAM/RAiD-API-2.yaml
```
# Replace wih the hosted API endpoint URL
host: "https://{API_URL_ENDPOINT}"

# Replace with path of API version
basePath: "/{API_VERSION}"

#Replace uri to AWS Lambda function uses *'jwt_redirection_handler'* from *'auth.py'*
/auth/jwt:
    post:
    ....
    uri: "arn:aws:apigateway:ap-southeast-1:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/arn:aws:lambda:ap-southeast-1:{YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT}:function:{LAMBDA_FUNCTION}/invocations"

# Replace custom authoriser Lambda URL and IAM Role. (NOTE. 'RAiD-API-2.yaml' only)
# Uses *'jwt_validation_handler'* from *'auth.py'*
securityDefinitions:
  CustomAuthorizerJwt:
  ...
    x-amazon-apigateway-authorizer:
        authorizerCredentials: "arn:aws:iam::{YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT}:role/{LAMBDA_ROLE_NAME}"
        authorizerUri: "arn:aws:apigateway:ap-southeast-1:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/arn:aws:lambda:ap-southeast-1:{YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT}:function:{LAMBDA_FUNCTION}/invocations"

```

To upload the API Gateway configuration to AWS use the following command:
```
aws apigateway import-rest-api --body 'file:///path/to/API_Swagger_template.json' --region ap-southeast-2
```
